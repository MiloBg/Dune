            <h2>Truthtrance</h2>
            <p>Forces a player to answer truthfully one "yes" or "no" question.</p>
            <p>
                Function: Truthtrance is used in one of three ways. First, to gain a specific piece of information 
                from another player. Hey, is this guy your traitor? One might say that this use is the default pick;
                a specific piece of information is always valuable. Second, specifically as a battle power similar 
                to the prescience, to allow you to play the proper weapon or defense. Third - and by far the most controversial - 
                is the use of truthtrance to degrade the quality of play of your opponent by forcing them to commit to a specific 
                course of action without the specific context to the situation that all decisions require to be a good one. 
                Common questions along this line are, "will you dial more than 5 in Arrakeen this turn?" or "will you ship to Tuek's 
                this turn?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Ancillary Functions: There are two. First, as Marriage Advice: Not everyone can emotionally handle the idea of being 
                forced to make a bad move because they had to answer a question 10 minutes ago where they had no idea what the 
                context would be at the moment of action. If your prospective mate really flips out over this and causes a massive 
                scene at the table, then maybe think about a date with that guy you met at Starbucks instead? Second, to pine away 
                the hours in useless conversation. You want to waste half an hour at Dune? Just give somebody two truthtrances and 
                the objective of using them both in some combination to find an obscure path to preventing a victory.
